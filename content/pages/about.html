                    Hi, thank you for visiting my site. I'm Tristian Azuara; a systems designer based in lovely San Diego.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I design information systems that help improve business and processes using software based technologies. Sometimes new processes are needed
                    and sometimes just a bit of automation is the right solution; whichever the case I will provide insights on how your business can use technology
                    to improve so that you can focus on the strategy to achieve your mision and vision statements.
                </p>

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a diverse set of skills that I've cultivated because of the variety of
                    projects that I've contributed and completed. All of my <em>technical</em> skills are served with <strong>strong interpersonal communication</strong>, <strong>assertive and analytical thought process</strong> and a relaxed but <strong>professional attitude</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd like to use my experience and help you reach your goals
                </p>

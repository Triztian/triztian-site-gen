summary: An inherited web application to process online spa cover orders.

### Overview

A company merger was in place and both companies had similiar technlogies due to being in the same market.
I had to find a way to take advantage of the tech assets that the merge would bring in.

## Why I worked in this project.

I was the right person for this project because I had built a similar web application for one of the 
merging companies, thus I would be really familiar with the domain knowledge of the inherited application.


### What problems got solved.

The most significant were:

 * Employees (customer service) workflow was greatly simplified because now they had access to the data in ONE
   application instead of requiring to log onto two different applications.

 * Data was centralized and it no longer had to be updated in two different places.

 * Customer was now able to check the status of its order (a product that had to be manufactured and that took 1 to 3 weeks to complete)

 * Customer was able to place their orders online, at any time (product highly configurable)

### Results

This allowed for the CEO to onboard new customers by leverging the company's tech offering of visibility and 
self-service. It also simplified customer service and production engineers workflow because data was now availble
in a digital format and could be placed into production much more easily.

It impacted revenue and operation costs in a positive way.

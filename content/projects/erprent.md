### Overview
The company was looking into transitioning its systems to use a Enterprise Resource Planning
system. The system would be deployed in phases, as a starting point a production (manufactoring)
reporting module will be created, followed with a Human Resources and Inventory module that supported
assembly and line provisioning operations.

### Why I worked in this project
I had already worked with them in creating several web applications that bridged legacy systems with the new
web applications, I've also had created an API that exposed the information contained in the legacy systems.

I had the experience and knowledge to search for an ERP system or framework that suited their budget and 
deadlines given their actual infrastructure.

### Problems that were solved

 * Production engineers no longer had to ask for WRITTEN production reports, it was all calculated 
   automatically by the ERP system.

 * There would now be traces of which work shift manager captured and verified the production count.

 * Data was now archived in a proper database system, queryable and auditible instead of being 
   scattered in Excel Spreadsheets.

 * Data was now accessible any time.

 * Inventory levels were now automatically calculated and initiated by employees rather than by the purchasing 
   department.

 * It was now possible to usage activity in the ERP system.

### Results

Production reports were now available immediately after the data had been captured by the work shift manager, this
allowed for production managers to analyse the data, inform their superiors, make forecast and decisions in a much
more timely manner that beneffited the company in keep their customers happy.

Also since everything was logged the system provided accountability for actions during each shift. It also foster
a culture of transparence within production managers and production engineers.

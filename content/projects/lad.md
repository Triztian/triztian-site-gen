summary: Single page application that allowed the loan agent to create the loan application

### Overview

A San Francisco based company needed to expand their bandwidth to keep moving forward the development
of the project that enabled the company's flagship product; *responsible loans*

### Why I worked on this project
I had the knowledge, experience and skills to provide additional man-power that would help increase the usability and quality of the product. Also, I was a good fit with the
team and company culture; based on their customer profile.

### What problems got solved

The most significant were:

 * Missing cross-browser functionality.

 * User Interface consistency accross browsers.

 * Big and small errors in the code base.

 * Repeated code fragments that were re-factored into reusable modules.

 * Improved semantics of HTML and CSS that allowed for easier Selenium tests.

### Results

The company decreased iteration times on the platform that allowed its flagship product to be offered.
It refined the platform and ease the loan application and disbursement process when
performed by the agent.

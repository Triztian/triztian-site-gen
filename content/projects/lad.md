summary: Single page application that allowed the loan agent to create the loan application

### Overview
A San Francisco based company needed to expand their bandwidth to keep moving forward the development
of the project that enabled the company's flagship product; *responsible loans*

### Why I worked on this project
I had the knowledge, experience and skills to provide the needed bandwidth. Also, I was a good fit with the
team and company culture, based on their customer profile.

### What problems got solved

The most significant were:

 * Small errors in the code base.

 * Non-scalable architecture.

 * Small bandwidth for moving the project forward.

### Results

The company started to iterate faster on the platform that allowed its flagship product to be offered.
It allowed to further refine the platform and ease the loan application and disbursement process when
performed by the agent.

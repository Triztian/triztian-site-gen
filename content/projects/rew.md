### Overview
A faulty batch of 100+ products that was already shipped to the customers was discovered, because
of that it was expected that many orders were to be re-manufactured a systemized approach 
was planned to avoid interrupting the workflow of new orders.

### Why I worked in this project
I had already worked with this company in developing their online order entry systems, which integrated 
with their manufacturing software. I had the knowledge about their product and the skills needed
to provide them with the warranty platform.

### What problems got solved

 * No more duplicate warranties, because the original claimed warranty was now trackable.

 * Remove the hassle for the customer of claiming a warranty, the process was now completly web-driven
   without the need to call customer service.

 * Unability to track the warranted order.

 * Remove the difficulty of determing if the warranty was applicable or not.

 * The need to retype the order into the manufacturing system, the re-make order integrated witht the
   manufacturing software.

### Results

Reduced operation costs in fulfilling the warranties. Reduced false-positive warranty cases. 
Improved the company's image because it proved that the company would take responsability of 
it's mistakes and reimburse the customer or provide a remake for the same order.

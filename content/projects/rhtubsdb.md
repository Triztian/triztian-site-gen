### Overview

The company needed to digitize itself; eliminating paper work and easing the job 
burden of customer service by automating certain steps of the order fulfillment 
process.

### Why I worked in this project
This was my first project in a professional environment. I had the skills needed to complete the project.
In a way it was a risk that the customer took but the outcome was much greater that the actual risk, and 
in the end everyone was happy with the results.

### What problems got solved

The most siginificant were:

 * Orders could be placed online, at anytime, from anywhere. Customer Service would review them 
   and place them into production each morning; if the order was correct and complete.

 * Order traces and logs stopped getting lost.

 * Logs of interaction between the customer and customer service were created.

 * Integrated with the manufacturing system, and avoided data duplication when placing the orders
   into the production line.

### Results

Created a new tech asset for the company, which would bring **many future** customers. Reduced operation costs
by simplifying customer service duties. Reduced manufacturing errors by removing the need to retype the order 
into the manufacturing system. Improved the companies image because it was now one of the few with IT automation
systems within the industry.

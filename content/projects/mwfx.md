summary: Mobile Hybrid Application that allowed for monitoring and processing of exchange rate transactions.

### Overview

An Indonesia based design firm needed for their mobile app designs to be implemented.
The application allowed for it's users to track rate exchange pairs and see how the prices (bid, ask, 
high and low) have changed at different time resolutions (seconds, minutes, hours and days).

Pricing information was obtained from Megawastu's propietary api.

### Why I worked on this project

Having worked as a frontend developer I had the experience and skills to create a solution that would be 
cross platform, usable and consistent.

### What problems got solved

 * Having to manually check trading prices.

 * Having to manually summarize price deltas accross different timespans.

 * Efforts to develop for different platforms were reduced by using a hybrid app development approach

### Results

An app was delivered within 60 days, meeting design requirements, functional requirements and several improvements to the 
API were suggested to improve integration with mobile devices.

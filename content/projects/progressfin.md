### Overview

A San Francisco based company needed to complete the spanish version of their site; which 
mainly served the hispanic community. It also needed to add a news and events section, 
with the ability to manage the publishing of news and events posts from the admin panel of the wordpress installation.

### Why I worked on this project

Having worked with the front end team to develop the company's main product platform. I had the skills 
and cultural knowledge to complete the spanish version of the site and to implement the news and events page in
an intuitive manner.

### What problems got solved

 * The site's spanish version was now available.

 * Many grammatical errors on the spanish version.

 * Wording of the translations; a proper use of "slang" words relevant to their customers.

 * Uniformity in presenting success stories of customers and the company's team.

 * Improved code base where possible.

### Results

Having the site available in the primary language of its customers reinforced the company's commitment 
to serving the hispanic community in helping them succeed and on creating a positive credit score. Also, it improved
the communication of the company's mission by using a more familiar tone and wording in spanish (a bit less formal).
